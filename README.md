1 Make Changes in Repo
Now, we'll make some changes to this very repository, and tell Git that we've done so.

Go back to your terminal window.
Open the folder by typing explorer.exe . (windows) or nautilus . (linux) or finder . (macosx)

Put your name on the end of Completed.md with your favourite text editor. I recommend getting VSCode for all platforms.

Save your changes.

Go back to your terminal window, and type in git add .. This tells git to look at all the changes you made, and prepare them for sharing.

Now type in git commit -m "Added my name". This tells git that you're sure you want to make these changes, and tells git to tell other people that these changes pertain to adding your name. (The -m stands for message. You must have a message with your changes, because git likes to enforce good coding practice.)

Now type git push origin master. This tells git to pass your changes to github. You may have to login using your github username and password (or your email and password).

git push <remote_location> <branch> : Pass your work on to someone else. If they'll take it.

Great! If you visit your forked repository now on github, you'll be able to see your new changes in your file.
